    /// A builder class builds a noise map by filling it with coherent-noise
    /// values generated from the surface of a three-dimensional mathematical
    /// object.  Each builder class defines a specific three-dimensional
    /// surface, such as a cylinder, sphere, or plane.
    /// 
    /// A builder class describes these input values using a coordinate system
    /// applicable for the mathematical object (e.g., a latitude/longitude
    /// coordinate system for the spherical noise-map builder.)  It then
    /// "flattens" these coordinates onto a plane so that it can write the
    /// coherent-noise values into a two-dimensional noise map.
    /// 
    /// To build the noise map, perform the following steps:
    /// - Pass the bounding coordinates to the SetBounds() method.
    /// - Pass the noise map size, in points, to the <see cref="SetDestSize"/> method.
    /// - Pass a NoiseMap object to the <see cref="SetDestNoiseMap"/> method.
    /// - Pass a noise module (derived from <see cref="Module"/>) to the
    ///   <see cref="SetSourceModule"/> method.
    /// - Call the <see cref="Build"/> method.
    /// 
    /// Note that SetBounds() is not defined in the abstract base class; it is
    /// only defined in the derived classes.  This is because each model uses
    /// a different coordinate system.
