# SharpNoise

A library for generating coherent noise. It can be used to procedurally create natural-looking textures, terrain heightmaps, among other things.

SharpNoise is a loose port of Jason Bevins' [libNoise](http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/)to C#. It adds some .Net features such as serialization and support for [C# Object Initializer syntax](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384062.aspx). SharpNoise is published unter the terms of the Gnu LGPL 3.
